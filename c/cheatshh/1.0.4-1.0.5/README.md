+### Contribution Guidelines
+1) For contribution of a library, it should have a suitable folder name(max 3 words) with commands.json and groups.json, similar to the format in other libraries. The `group` field should be "yes", `bookmark` field should be "no".
+2) For bug fixes, it will be great if you could discuss first in Issues before directly putting a PR.
