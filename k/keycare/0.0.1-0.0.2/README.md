 1. **Keywords extraction**: KeyCARE implements several unsupervised term extraction techniques such as [*YAKE*](https://github.com/LIAAD/yake), [*RAKE*](https://pypi.org/project/rake-nltk/), [*TextRank*](https://pypi.org/project/pytextrank/) or [*KeyBERT*](https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT) to automatically extract key terms from a text.
-2. **Term categorization**: KeyCARE allows the application of term clustering techniques to group similar terms, as well as the training and application of supervised techniques to classify keywords into predefined categories.

 3. **Semantic relation classification**: Beyond the identification and categorization of terms, the library supports the use of neural classification models to extract the semantic relation between two terms by means of EXACT, BROAD, NARROW and NO_relation relationships, which allows interconnecting the extracted terms and can be used for terminological enrichment, among other tasks.

 ## 1. About The Project
 [Back to ToC](#toc)
 KeyBERT provides a common interface for extracting, categorizing and associating terms extracted from a text: 
 
 1. **Keywords extraction**: KeyCARE implements several unsupervised term extraction techniques such as [*YAKE*](https://github.com/LIAAD/yake), [*RAKE*](https://pypi.org/project/rake-nltk/), [*TextRank*](https://pypi.org/project/pytextrank/) or [*KeyBERT*](https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT) to automatically extract key terms from a text.
-2. **Term categorization**: KeyCARE allows the application of term clustering techniques to group similar terms, as well as the training and application of supervised techniques to classify keywords into predefined categories.
